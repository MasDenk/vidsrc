      2. Open vercel and create `new project` and choose your `forked repo`.
      3. Use the default settings and click `deploy`.

      `IMPORTANT `: Vercel is facing a bug recently so setting node version to `18.x` is a fix for it.

### FEATURES
```
- async support - Most process are async but still some fixes are needed.
- very fast results
- subtitle support for every sources.
```
### NOTES
```
- Dont overload the deployment.
- This api is made for educational purpouse only. This is just a simple scrapper built arround `https://github.com/Ciarands` vidsrc downloader.This project was only made to prevent ads and redirects caused by the `iframe`s
- This api isnt a copy of the inspired project,but its a complete reqrite of code to make it work as an api and use async style to give vary fast results.
- Dont perform bulk request to the api and store the m3u8's returned,cuz they may not work after 24 hours or so.This api scrape websites that have `video on demand` feature so storing it is useless.
```
